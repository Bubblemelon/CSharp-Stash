  /* What are Stucts:
   *
   * A programming construct to define custom types. (behave like built-in types)
   *
   * A lightweight data structure that represent related pieces of
   * information as a single item.
   *
   * Structs can contain a variety of members including constructors, fields,
   * constants, properties, indexers, methods, operators, events, and even nested types.
   *
   * Remember to keep it lightweight, otherwise create a Class instead.
   *
   * Reason for being lightweight:
   * New instances of a class is placed on the heap. (reference in memory to classes)
   * Instantiated structs are placed on the stack. (directly refers to stuct instance)
   *
   * Most of the built-in types in Visual C#, such as int, bool, char,
   * are defined by structs.
   *
   * A Struct is preceded with a access modifier:
   *
   * Public: The type is available to code running in any assembly
   * Internal: (Default if not specified) The type is available to any
   *           code within the same assembly only.
   * Private: The type is only available to code within the struct that contains it.
   *          Only use the private access modifier with nested structs.
   *
   * It is possible to have many structs in one file:
   *
   * (1) When all structs are encapsulated by a namespace,
   *     remember to do "using namespace_name;" on the file with main funct.
   *
   * (2) When all struct are encapsulated by a class,
   *     need to make accessor for the struct.
   *     https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/985e8679-ac03-4299-8afb-ae36a997b83b/using-struct-inside-the-class?forum=csharplanguage
   *
   * Inheritance:
   *
   * (1) Class cannot inherit from other structs nor can structs inherit other classes.
   * (2) A struct can inherit the object class, meaning "a struct within a class" e.g. Wheel will inherit Car
   * (3) Structs can implement custom interfaces
   *
   * A property:
   * Is a programming construct that enables client code
   * to get or set the value of private fields within a struct or a class.
   * The property behaves like a public field
   *
   * An Auto-Implement property:
   * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties
   * public string FirstName { get; set; }
   *
   * Accessors:
   * (1) A get accessor to provide read access to a field.
   *
   * Possible to initilize like so:
   * public string FirstName { get; set; } = "Jane";  <-- can't do that within structs
   *
   *
   * FIELDS --- Fields:
   * Are variables of a struct !
   *
   * Refer to StructUsageExample file to demonstrate usage of this struct !
